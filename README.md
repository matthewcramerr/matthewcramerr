0-> I am currently coding the Campus Hands Mobile app, which will be my first app, and will have SQL databases for both workers and customers, customer interface, worker interface, admin panel, a few cool features, and a simple user friendly design for both workers and customers. Ideally, this app will work on any iphone and any ipad. Expected launch 06/01/2025
